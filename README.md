Hello,I'm Akshat<br />
I am a Student pursuing B.Tech in ECE at IIT Guwahati <br />
Roll No. : 210102011<br />
I am currently exploring Competetive programming and Web Development as a field of interest


I am interested in open source as it would help me learn a lot of things and help me gain knowledge.
Also contributing to the open source project which I am interested would be a lot of fun.
